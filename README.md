# 🧩 Autism Study: Global Disparities & Predictive Modeling  

### 📘 Overview  
This project investigates **global disparities in autism diagnoses** and explores how demographic, cultural, and diagnostic factors influence assessment outcomes. Using open datasets and the **AQ-10 autism screening questionnaire**, the study applies data science and machine learning to understand how autism is identified worldwide.  

---

### 🧠 Objectives  
- Analyze **age, gender, and ethnicity** as predictors of autism diagnoses.  
- Use **logistic regression** and **random forest models** to detect diagnostic biases.  
- Visualize **global autism prevalence** and **research output** by country.  

---

### ⚙️ Methods  
- **Data Sources:** AQ-10 Adult & Child datasets (UCI), U.S. Department of Health Autism Prevalence Studies.  
- **Statistical Analysis:** Logistic regression models for adult and child datasets.  
- **Machine Learning:** Random Forest and Decision Tree classifiers on AQ-10 responses.  
- **Visualization:** World maps, histograms, and feature importance plots.  

---

### 📊 Key Findings  
- The **AQ-10** performs better for **children (84%)** than for **adults (87%)**, revealing age-based screening differences.  
- **Gender and ethnicity** influenced diagnosis likelihood, suggesting cultural or sampling biases.  
- **Question 10** (“difficulty making friends” / “difficulty understanding intentions”) was the strongest diagnostic indicator.  
- Global data revealed **research disparities**, with higher autism prevalence reports in **China and Saudi Arabia** but more research publications in **the U.S. and Europe**.
